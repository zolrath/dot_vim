## Requirements

**Mac**

 * [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) - I'm currently using [snapshot 64](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads)

**Windows**

 * [gVim](http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc) - I'm currently using [Wu Yongwei's](http://wyw.dcweb.cn) pre-compiled [gVim 7.3.333](http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=gvim73.zip) because it has Ruby support and the latest patches

## Notes

Be sure to always edit the vimrc using `,v`, which opens the vimrc in the .vim folder. Vim has a nasty habit of overriding symlinks.
Keybindings and Plugin Specific options are located in the plugin/settings directory.
